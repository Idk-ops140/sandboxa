    <h1>Elenchos: Discontinued</h1>
    <p>
      Dear Users,
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s with a heavy heart that I announce the discontinuation of <b>Elenchos</b>. 
      This project began as a dream, inspired by the amazing sandbox game <b>Sandboxels</b>. 
      My goal was to create a similar, creative, and interactive experience for you all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, I realized that while creating Elenchos was a wonderful learning journey, it felt redundant compared to what inspired it. 
      Sandboxels is already an incredible sandbox game that fulfills many of the ideas I hoped to bring to life. 
      With that in mind, I’ve decided to shut down Elenchos to focus on other creative endeavors.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to thank everyone who supported this project, tested its features, and gave feedback along the way. 
      Your engagement made the effort worthwhile, and I’ll always cherish the time spent building this project.
    </p>
    <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
    <p>
      While Elenchos is no longer active, you can explore <b>Sandboxels</b> to satisfy your sandbox creativity needs. 
      This isn’t the end of my journey as a creator, and I look forward to starting new projects in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for being part of this chapter.
    </p>
